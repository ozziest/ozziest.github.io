      "summary": "I am a software developer who has 5 years experience about software development, especially in web development. I have created different web applications, using PHP, C# or NodeJS. I am familiar modern web frameworks (back-end or front-end) such as Laravel, Symfony, AngularJS, VueJS or React. I am also familiar unit testing concept and libraries such as PHPUnit, CodeCeption, Mockery, Mocha or Jasmine. Further I would be careful about SOLID principles and best practices when I develop a web application in order to write readable, maintainable and testable code. In addition, I love to play with Symfony components as a hobby. You may check my GitHub account and review my codes which I've written if you want to learn more information about me.",
