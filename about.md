I have been working as software developer since 2010, especially in web development. 

I have created different web applications, using PHP, C# or NodeJS. I am familiar modern web frameworks (back-end or front-end) such as .Net MVC, .Net Core, Laravel, Symfony, AngularJS, VueJS or React. I am also familiar unit testing concept and libraries such as xUnit, PHPUnit, CodeCeption, Mockery, Mocha or Jasmine. 

Further I would be careful about SOLID principles and best practices when I develop a web application in order to write readable, maintainable and testable code. And that's why i love refactoring... 

In addition, I love to play with Symfony components as a hobby. Also I have experience about continuous integration tools such as Travis-CI and Jenkins. You may check my GitHub account and review my codes which I've written if you want to learn more information about me.
